# This is an example deploy renewal hook for certbot that copies newly updated certificates to the Mosquitto certificates directory and sets the ownership # and permissions so only the mosquitto user can access them, then signals
# Mosquitto to reload certificates.

# RENEWED_DOMAINS will match the domains being renewed for that certificate, so
# may be just "example.com", or multiple domains "www.example.com example.com"
# depending on your certificate.

# Place this script in /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/ and make it
# executable after editing it to your needs.

# Set which domain this script will be run for
MY_DOMAIN="[YOUR DOMAIN]"
# Set the directory that the certificates will be copied to.
CERTIFICATE_DIR="[DIR MOUNT OF MOSQUITTO CONTAINER ON HOST]"

if [ "${RENEWED_DOMAINS}" = "${MY_DOMAIN}" ]; then
        # Copy new certificate to Mosquitto directory
        cp ${RENEWED_LINEAGE}/fullchain.pem ${CERTIFICATE_DIR}/server.pem
        cp ${RENEWED_LINEAGE}/privkey.pem ${CERTIFICATE_DIR}/server.key

        # Set ownership to Mosquitto
        chown mosquitto: ${CERTIFICATE_DIR}/server.pem ${CERTIFICATE_DIR}/server.key

        # Ensure permissions are restrictive
        chmod 0600 ${CERTIFICATE_DIR}/server.pem ${CERTIFICATE_DIR}/server.key

        # Tell Mosquitto to reload certificates and configuration
        pkill -HUP -x mosquitto
